\chapter{Introduction}
This document describes and documents the software developed in the bachelor project.
The purpose is to make decisions and structures clear and help developers looking into the source code understanding what they see.

Two applications are developed during the project, a cross-platform front-end mobile application and a web \gls{api} back-end application.

The front-end application is written in \gls{typescript} with \glsi{ng2}.
The \gls{ui} layer is provided by the \glsi{nativescript} framework and configured to compile to both the \textit{Android} and \textit{iOS} operating systems.
For communications the library \glsi{apollo:client} is used to implement the \glsi{graphql} specification.

The back-end application is a \glsi{node} application written in \gls{typescript}.
It is based on the \glsi{apollo:server} for web \gls{api} functionality and uses \glsi{graphql} as communication specification.
