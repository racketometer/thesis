\section{Deployment model}
The deployment model is meant to illustrate where the different software packages are deployed, as shown on figure \ref{deploymentmodel}.

The front-end codebase is compiled into two different file extensions, i.e. \verb+.jar+ for \textit{Android} and \verb+.app+ for \textit{iOS}. 
The compiled files are then deployed to their respective devices or uploaded to each platform's \gls{appstore}.

The back-end codebase is deployed to a \glsi{heroku} infrastructure running \glsi{node} and setup with environment variables, see section \ref{sec:staging}, to communicate with a \glsi{mongodb} instance hosted on \glsi{mlab}.
