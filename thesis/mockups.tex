\section{Mock-ups}
Mock-ups of each mobile application view were made usually within the same sprint as a view was planned, but always before implementation of the view started.

On figures \ref{fig:mockup_login} and \ref{fig:mockup_session} the login and session view mock-ups are shown, created with the web based service \glsi{moqups}.

Individual views are created as mock-ups and then linked together to mimic the flow of the application. 
This made it possible for the consultants to test the application flow before any code was written.

They are all available on the following URL:
