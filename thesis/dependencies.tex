\chapter{Dependencies}
\label{ch:dependencies}
The project utilizes several external dependencies on both the front- and back-end applications.
They are managed with the package manager \glsi{npm} for \glsi{node}.

All but one of these dependencies are free to use and licensed with \gls{oss} licenses, that grant the user rights to use and in most cases modify and copy the source code.
They are all listed in the documentation, chapter \ref{doc:ch:dependencies}.

One dependency is a commercial product and not free to use, namely the \verb+nativescript-telerik-ui-pro+ package.
The costs of the package is kr. 1400 (\$199) \citep{dependencies:nativescript} per developer, but is provided by Telerik free of charge for this project on a student license.

The project utilizes only a subset of this package and may be too costly for the final product.
To avoid this cost, an effort could be made into finding an alternative product that can provide the same functionality, but without the commercial license.
