\chapter{Dependencies}
\label{ch:dependencies}
The project utilizes several external dependencies on both the front and back-end applications.
They are managed with the package manager \glsi{npm} for \glsi{node}.

All but one of these dependencies are \gls{oss} and free to use.
They do hold different licenses on the source code which can be of special concern, why they are listed in the documentation, chapter \ref{doc:ch:dependencies}. 
This project does however not use any dependencies that require special steps.

One dependency is a commercial product and not free to use, namely the \verb+nativescript-telerik-ui-pro+ package.
The costs of the package is kr. 1400 (\$199) \citep{dependencies:nativescript} per developer, but is provided by Telerik free of charge for this project on a student license.

The project utilizes only a subset of this package and may be too costly for the final product.
To avoid this cost, an effort could be made into finding an alternative product that can provide the same functionality, but without the commercial license.
