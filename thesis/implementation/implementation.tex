\section{Algorithms}
As mentioned in the introduction, section \ref{sec:externalCollaboration}, the consultants deliver the data algorithms to analyse the measurements from the racket.
These algorithms are written in Python and because of this not directly available to the \glsi{node} environment on the back-end and JavaScript run-time on the front-end.

On the back-end it is possible to execute Python scripts with \glsi{node} if the Python compiler is installed on the server.
It is, however, not possible on the native devices.
Because of this, the algorithms are ported to \gls{typescript} to make them available on both the back-end and front-end.

The algorithms are not optimized or re-factored, but the performance is still increased considerably when running on \glsi{node} as compared to running the scripts in Python.
Early measurements indicate a 10 times performance increase.
