\chapter{Pre-study}
\label{ch:preStudy}
Here follows pre-studies on technologies and tools to be used throughout the project, conducted in the project's initial phase.
See chapter \ref{ch:Requirements} for more details of the requirements.

When researching technologies, focus will be on new cutting edge technologies.
This comes with a risk as they are not as battle tested as older technologies.
They often have more bugs or changing \glspl{api} and this can cause problems during development, but they also often provide better performance and new features or advantages over their counterparts.
The trade-off is assessed to be worth it as we as developers get experience with new technologies that might be relevant for years to come.
