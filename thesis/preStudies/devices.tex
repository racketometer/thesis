\section{Distribution of used operating systems}\label{preStudy:devices}

The mobile and tablet operating system market is dominated by two products, i.e. \textit{Android} (65.01\%) and \textit{iOS} (28.00\%), running on 93.01\% of all devices as of October 2016.
Other systems include \textit{Windows Phone} at 2.72\% and \textit{Java ME} at 1.79\% \citep{preStudy:devices:companies}.
The latter ones are omitted in the following, as the market share is below 10\%.

Several versions of each system are in broad use.
\textit{iOS} is dominated by versions 9 and 10 covering 92\% of usage \citep{preStudy:devices:apple}.
\textit{Android} versions are more scattered.
Most used is version 4.4 \textit{KitKat} covering 25.2\% followed by 6.0 \textit{Marshmallow} covering 24.0\% \citep{preStudy:devices:android}.

The references for these numbers are updated regularly why the statistics are replicated in appendices \ref{app:ch:androidDistribution} and \ref{app:ch:appleDistribution}.
