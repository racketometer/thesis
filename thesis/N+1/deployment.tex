\subsection{Deployment model}
The deployment model is meant to illustrate where the different software packages are deployed, as shown on figure \ref{deploymentmodel}.

The \glsi{nativescript} codebase is compiled into 2 different file extensions i.e. \verb+.jar+ for \textit{Android} and \verb+.app+ for \textit{iOS}. The compiled files are then deployed directly to their respective devices or uploaded to each platform's individual \gls{appstore}.

The back-end codebase is deployed on a web server with a \glsi{node} environment as well as a \glsi{mongodb}.
