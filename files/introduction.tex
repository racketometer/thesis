\section*{Work process}
The project process is managed with the agile SCRUM development framework. 
Tasks are managed in a backlog and pulled into sprints of two weeks. 
The process of adding tasks to the backlog are done in gromming sessions where the next parts of the project is discussed and reflection, i.e., retrospective, of tasks not finished or newly arisen issues are weighted and prioritized.

Visualization of tasks and their state is done with an online scrum board. 
The tool to use is decided in a pre-study, see section \ref{preStudy:scrum}.

There is no delegation of specific tasks, e.g., front-end and back-end. 
Instead tasks are solved as time and prioritization sees fit.
