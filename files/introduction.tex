Sports wearables are on the rise with new products launched every month. 
Most large technology companies like \textit{Apple, Inc.} and \textit{Samsung} are investing heavily into the market and \textit{Gartner, Inc.} predicts that ''\textit{From 2015 through 2017, smartwatch adoption will have 48 percent growth(...)}'' \citep{introduction:relevance:gartner}.

New products that enables users to understand their performances and activities are in high demand, but most of the wearables are centered around wristbands and smart phone applications. 
These have certain limitations and the precision of the data gathered can be of very different quality.
The product of this project if different. 
It is in the center of the action and gives precise measurements of what forces act on the racket.
With this in mind the product is different in the technological sense but fits the same user demand of existing wearables.
