\chapter{Pre-study}
Here follows pre-studies on technologies and tools to be used throughout the project, conducted in the project's initial phase.
See chapter \ref{ch:Requirements} for more details of the requirements.

When researching technologies, focus will be on new cutting edge technologies. 
This comes with a risk as they are not as battle tested as older technologies. 
They often have more bugs and this can cause problems during development but they also often provide better performance and new features or advantages over their counterparts. 
The trade-off is assessed to be worth it as we as developers get experience with new technologies that might be relevant for years to come.
