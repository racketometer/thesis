\section{Distribution of used operating systems}\label{preStudy:devices}

The mobile and tablet operating system market is dominated by two products, i.e. \textit{Android} (64.07\%) and \textit{iOS} (28.64\%), running on 92.71\% of all devices.
Other systems include \textit{Windows Phone} at 2.87\% and \textit{Java ME} at 1.86\% \citep{preStudy:devices:companies}.
The latter ones are omitted in the following, as the market share is below 10\%.

Several versions of each system are in broad use.
\textit{iOS} is dominated by versions 8 and 9 covering 97\% of usage \citep{preStudy:devices:apple}.
\textit{Android} versions are more scattered. 
Most used is version 4.4 \textit{KitKat} covering 29.2\% followed by 5.1 \textit{Lollipop} covering 21.4\% \citep{preStudy:devices:android}.

The references for these numbers are updated regularly why the statistics are replicated in appendices \ref{appendix:androidDistribution} and \ref{appendix:appleDistribution}.
