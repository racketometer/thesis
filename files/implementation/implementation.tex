\section{Algorithms}
As mentioned in the introduction, section \ref{sec:externalCollaboration}, the consultants deliver the data algorithms to analyse the measurements from the racket.
These algorithms are written in Python and by this not directly available to the \gls{node} environment on the back-end and JavaScript run-time on the front-end.

On the back-end it is possible to execute Python scripts with \gls{node} if the Python compiler is installed on the server.
It is, however, not possible on the native devices.
As of this, the algorithms is ported to TypeScript to make it available on both the back-end and front-end.

The algorithms are not optimized or re-factored, but it still increases performance considerable when running on \gls{node} as compared to running the scripts in Python.
Early measurements indicate a 10 times performance increase.
