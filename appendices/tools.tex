\chapter{Tools used}
This appendix lists all development tools used through out the project.

\subsection*{Git / GitHub}
\textit{Git} is used for version control in collaboration with the web service \glsi{github} to manage issue tracking and pull requests.
As the project source code is \gls{oss} this is also the source distribution channel.

\subsection*{LaTex / texmaker}
The thesis and documentation are typeset in \LaTeX\ and the source is committed in \textit{Git} to handle version control.
This gives the ability to track history of the documents and published releases are easily identified in the \textit{Git} history.

\subsection*{Lucidchart}
Web application for chart drawing, used to create all figures in the documents.

\subsection*{Microsoft Visual Studio Code}
Code editor used to write the front- and back-end applications.

\subsection*{NativeScript CLI}
The \gls{cli} for \glsi{nativescript} was used to build and run the front-end application.

\subsection*{Travis CI}
The \glsi{ci} web service \glsi{travis} is used for running tests and builds of both the front- and back-end applications when changes are committed to \glsi{github}.

\subsection*{Waffle}
Web service for \glsi{scrum:board} visualization, used to plan and groom sprints as well as keeping an overview of the project progress.
